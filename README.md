## Description

Omegui is a set of tools to make Tamagui easier to set up and customize.

This is the theme generator, which allows you to create a theme for Tamagui's component library from a minimal set of colors. You can also use preset themes to get started quickly.

## Upcoming

- Support for dark themes
- Better documentation
- Wrapper for Tamagui components to add color variants (e.g. primary, secondary, etc.)
- Support for theming border radius, shadows, animations and other properties (aiming for parity with daisyUI themes)
